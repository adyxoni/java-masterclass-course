# java-masterclass-course

Here, I will list some of the challenges I finished from the course which have been confirmed successful. I haven't had any issues while doing these and so far haven't had any ambiguties while going through the course.

I will mostly focus on polymorphism, inheritance, classes and generally OOP concepts that I handle without any issues with Java. 
Start: 5th of January
